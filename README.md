### The Data AntiNuke Bot Stores

Anti-Nuke bot stores your discord server id for the custom prefix, enabling and disabling anti nuke features. It also stores messages in a dict for the anti spam feature. The bot automatically deletes these messages after muting the user who's spamming or after 15 days.

### You want to delete data?

We have a support server you can ping the devs or you can dm `Saad.#5088` to delete your data.
